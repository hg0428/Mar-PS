# Snake Game Challenge

NOTE: This used an older version of MAR-PS that had lower quality generation and worse prompting.
I challenged my reasoning system to create a snake game in Python.
I challenged GPT-4o to do the same.
`snake-game.py` is this system's attempt and `snake-game-4o.py` is GPT-4o's attempt.

I used and rated each. GPT-4o's system worked, but was buggy. The quit button didn't work and sometimes if you turn too much it would say game over.
The reasoning system created a much better game that was almost bug free. However, it's initial version had one small bug that prevented it from running. After telling it about the bug, it fixed it immediately.
